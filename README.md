# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

# New React technics

sprint 11

- API using React – Fetching and interacting with APIs efficiently within a React app.
- Mock Server – Simulating a backend to test API calls without relying on an actual server.
- useEffect – Handling side effects in functional components, like fetching data when a component mounts.
- useState – Managing component state dynamically within functional components.
- Getting images using strings – Likely referring to displaying images from URLs stored as strings, useful for dynamically rendering assets.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
